=================

Guess a customer's rating from their review    

[Visit the app](https://rating-pred.herokuapp.com/)   

[I train about 150,000 reviews](http://i.imgur.com/ki8VQbu.png), and based on my test on the remaining data, this NB Classifier is correct 60-70% of the time, with quite a few false positives, i.e. terrible ratings that get 5 stars.  

It will be updated as I learn more about Classifier. Not bad for my first attempt at building an ML-related app (Insert Obama's meme here). =D
